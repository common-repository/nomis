Use this plugin to display properties out of the backoffice Nomis on your
website.

== Description ==

This plugin is an extension of the backoffice Nomis, which is used by real
estate brokers to manage their properties. Via this plugin, a WordPress designer
can display all the properties of that broker easily on his website. An API key
is required for it to work, so it's no use for people who are no customer of
Anno MMX. You also need to have JSON natively installed on your webserver.
Wordpress does offer a replacement for this, but it's way too slow
